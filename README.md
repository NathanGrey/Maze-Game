# Maze-Game
Assignment 6.1: Midterm Project
Description
You will be implementing the maze game using topics covered in Modules 1 through 6. The player will be able to navigate the maze using keyboard input. Once the player reaches the exit, they win the game. Your instructor will keep this assignment open for two modules. You have until the end of Module 7 to submit your completed game.
Here is the maze you'll be navigating in this assignment.

Midterm Maze
To represent this in program, we will use a two-dimensional array and ASCII characters. Here is it is in all its ASCII glory:

Midterm Maze
Specifications:

The player is represented by '@' on the map.
Walls are denoted by '|' or '-' on the map. The player cannot walk through these.
The player can move: up, down, left, or right, as long as that direction is not blocked by a wall.
At the end of the game the player should be displayed with a win message and the number of steps it took to solve the maze.
Requirements:

Create a Visual Studio project. Naming convention for project: [yourlastname]_midterm
Create maze_game.cpp file in the new project.
Project must build and compile without any errors.
Must meet runtime specifications from above.
Use functions to logically organize code and maximize code reuse.
Use of a loop to handle player input and displaying the level
Proper code formatting and style. Should use correct variable naming practices
Helpful Tip

Use a two-dimensional array to represent the maze.
Track the player's coordinates.
Use cin for user input and cout for output to the console.
Use functions to break down player abilities. There should be a functions for moving, displaying the maze, etc.
Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to get a working understanding of loops.
